<p>Welcome to Yani Guan's personal website</p>
<p>I am a Graduate Researcher Assistant at University of California, Los Angeles. 
    I'm interested in solving problems in heterogeneous catalysis using multi-scale simulations and AI for Science methods. 
    My goal is to accelerate the rational understanding and design of catalyst by combining efficient simulation methods and comprehensive mechanism understanding. 
    </p>
<p>Open to discussion on theoretical chemistry and surface catalysis!</p>
